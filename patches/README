This is a tree of patched files from bullet.  Since we can not depend on
patch on Windows, we pre-patch the files and use cmake -E copy to put
them in place.  This was created by applying the patches found in the
root directory of this project *.diff. Those patches were applied on
a system with patch and the changed files were then put into a tar file.
That tar file was extracted into this patches directory. If more files need
patches you should create a diff file or update the diff files and then
copy the affected files into this tree.  Then, add the copy -E command
in the patch step of the external project in the CMakeLists.txt.
